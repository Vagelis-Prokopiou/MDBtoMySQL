# MDBtoMySQL

Bash script that automates MS Access to MySQL, data migration.

## Aim of the project

The aim of this script, is to help the transition of Windows-Microsoft-proprietary software users, to the GNU/Linux-open source world/community. Remember, "it is more blessed to give than to receive"...

## Usage

The script asks for some basic input.

* The credentials of the mysql user, in order to run the queries.
* The name of the MS Access db (file).
* The name of the database that you want to create.

Then, everything is executed automatically.

## Contribute

Since I cannot test every possible case of database schema, if you encounter errors with your db setup, create an issue in order to fix it and incorporate it in the project.

All development happens on the "develop" branch. Make sure to target any PRs to that branch.
